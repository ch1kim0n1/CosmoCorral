# CheaterBuster Download Page

A beautiful download page with animated backgrounds, theme toggle (light/dark), and a zip file download button.

## Features

- **Animated Backgrounds**: 
  - Dark theme: Twinkling stars with smooth parallax
  - Light theme: Animated mountain ranges with snow caps
- **Company Branding**: CheaterBuster logo and name
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes
- **Download Button**: Large, animated button that downloads an empty ZIP file

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## How It Works

The download button creates a minimal empty ZIP file using the standard ZIP file structure and triggers a download in the browser. The page maintains all the theming and background animations from the landing page.
