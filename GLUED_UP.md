# Space Cowboy: Project Glue-Up Complete ✅

## What Was Built

You now have a **fully integrated student monitoring system** with real-time cheating detection powered by AI. Here's what's connected:

### 📊 **The Three Components Are Now Wired Together:**

```
STUDENT (Rust Client)
    ↓ Sends real-time activity packages
    ↓ Every 5 seconds
    ↓
SERVER (Python Pipeline)
    ├─ Ingests raw activity
    ├─ Normalizes data
    ├─ Aggregates in 30s/60s/5m windows
    ├─ Detects anomalies (rules-based, cheap)
    ├─ Escalates suspicious packages to Gemini API
    ├─ Gemini analyzes & returns "what" and "why"
    ├─ Creates FlaggedReport with evidence
    └─ Broadcasts to professor dashboard
    ↓
PROFESSOR (Next.js Dashboard)
    ├─ Receives live alerts
    ├─ Sees suspected activity + confidence
    ├─ Views detailed evidence & recommendations
    ├─ Takes action: review, terminate, mark false positive
    └─ Audits all decisions
```

## Data Flow Breakdown

### **Stage 1: Collection** (Student Client)
Student is taking exam → EyeCore collects every 5 seconds:
```
ActivityPackage {
  system_metrics: { cpu_usage: 42%, memory: 58%, ... }
  process_data: { active_app: "Chrome", app_switches: 0, ... }
  input_dynamics: { keystroke_rate: 65/sec, variance: 0.1, ... }
  network_activity: { bytes_sent: 150KB, received: 850KB, ... }
  focus_metrics: { focus_score: 0.85, ... }
  voice_data: { sentiment: +0.3, emotion: "confident", ... }
}
```

### **Stage 2: Transmission** (WebSocket)
```
Client → Server (ws://localhost:8765)
{
  "method": "Package",
  "data": {
    "token": "student-auth-token",
    "student_id": "john.doe@edu.com",
    "data": { /* ActivityPackage */ }
  }
}
```

### **Stage 3: Processing** (Server Pipeline)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Ingest & Normalize                   │ ✓ JSON validation
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Store raw package                    │ ✓ SQLite log
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Add to aggregation windows           │ ✓ 30s/60s/5m buffers
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Detect anomalies                     │ 
│   - CPU > 90%? No                       │
│   - Focus < 0.3? No                     │
│   - Network spike? No                   │
│   → Result: NO ANOMALIES                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. Check rules                          │
│   → No rules triggered                  │
│   → Don't escalate to Gemini            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. Cost-efficient decision              │ ✓ Save API cost!
│   "Package clean, logging only"         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 7. Store & broadcast                    │ ✓ DB only
│   "No alert to professor"               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Stage 4: Suspicious Activity** (Real Example)
```
Student suddenly opens Discord & System Settings
CPU spikes to 92%, Focus drops to 0.12, Network: 18MB/30s
↓
ANOMALIES DETECTED:
  ✓ CPU usage: 92% > 90% threshold
  ✓ Focus score: 0.12 < 0.3 threshold
  ✓ Network activity: 18MB > 10MB threshold
  ✓ App switches: 5 switches in 30s (elevated)
↓
RULES TRIGGERED:
  ✓ "resource_spike" - Network anomaly detected
  ✓ "distraction_burst" - Low focus + high app switching
  ✓ "network_anomaly" - Critical network activity
↓

PROFESSOR SEES:

  Student: John Doe (john.doe@edu.com)
  Activity: Unauthorized Resource Access (91% confidence)
  
  Why Suspected: Sudden spike in network traffic (18x baseline) while 
  attempting system settings access and using Discord. Pattern suggests 
  attempting to access restricted resources or communicate with external sources.
  
  Evidence:
  • Network traffic 18MB vs baseline 1MB (18x spike)
  • Focus score 0.12 vs baseline 0.8 (distraction/attempting bypass)
  • Discord is communication app, not exam-related
  • System Settings access unusual during exam
  
  Recommendation: URGENT - Review session recording immediately
  
  [View Recording] [Request Verification] [Terminate Session] [Mark False Positive]

### ✅ **Intelligent Analysis** (Gemini API)
- Analyzes only when rules trigger
- Returns structured JSON with:
  - `suspected_activity` (type of cheating)
  - `confidence` (0-1 score)
  - `why_suspected` (1-2 sentence explanation)
  - `evidence` (list of specific pieces of evidence)
  - `recommendation` (action professor should take)
  - `alternative_explanations` (avoid false positives)

### ✅ **Real-Time Broadcasting**
- Professor dashboard receives alerts instantly
- WebSocket push (not polling)
- Can connect multiple professors

### ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**
- All packages stored in database
- All flagged reports persisted
- All professor actions logged
- Immutable record for compliance

## How to Test It

### **Quick Test (5 minutes)**

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start client:**
   ```bash
   cd client/eyecore_mvp
   cargo run --release
   ```

3. **Simulate suspicious activity:**
   ```bash
   python tests/test_suspicious_package.py
   # Sends package with:
   # - CPU: 95% (exceeds 90% threshold)
   # - Focus: 0.15 (below 0.3 threshold)
   # - Network: 15MB/30s (exceeds 10MB threshold)
   # Should trigger Gemini analysis!
   ```

4. **Check professor dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   # Should show ALERT in real-time
   ```

## Architecture Highlights

### **Why This Design?**

1. **Modular**: Each component (collect, aggregate, detect, analyze) is separate
2. **Scalable**: Can add 100+ students without code changes
3. **Cost-Efficient**: Gemini API called only when needed (~1% of packages)
4. **Real-Time**: WebSocket ensures instant alerts
5. **Auditable**: Every decision logged with evidence
6. **Privacy-First**: No keystrokes/content recorded, only metadata

### **Separation of Concerns**

```
STUDENT SIDE                    PROFESSOR SIDE
├─ Collects activity           ├─ Views alerts
├─ Sends to server             ├─ Reviews evidence
└─ (No analysis)               └─ Takes action
         ↓
    SERVER SIDE
    ├─ Ingests data
    ├─ Detects anomalies
    ├─ Calls Gemini (when needed)
    ├─ Stores everything
    └─ Broadcasts to professors
```
