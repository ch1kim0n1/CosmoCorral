### 🎯 Your Focus Analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Focus Level** | 0.11 / 1.0 | 🔴 **Very Low** - Minimal engagement |
| **Context Switches** | 11 switches | Moderate app switching |
| **Productive Time** | 228 seconds (3.8 minutes) | Active session time |

**Focus Breakdown:**
- 🔴 **0.0 - 0.3**: Very Low Focus (You are here)
- 🟡 **0.4 - 0.6**: Moderate Focus  
- 🟢 **0.7 - 1.0**: High Focus

**Insight**: Low focus level suggests you may be distracted, reading documentation, or in planning mode rather than actively coding.

---

### ⌨️ Your Input Activity

| Activity | Count | Analysis |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Mouse Clicks** | 1 click | Very minimal clicking |
| **Keyboard Events** | 8 key presses | Light typing activity |
| **Idle Duration** | 25 seconds | Recent inactivity detected |

**Activity Pattern**: Low input activity combined with 25s idle time suggests you're reading, thinking, or away from keyboard.

---

### 🌐 Your Network Activity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Bytes Sent** | 310,632 bytes (~303 KB) |
| **Bytes Received** | 1,902,910 bytes (~1.86 MB) |
| **Active Connections** | 41 connections |

**Network Pattern**: Moderate network activity. More data received than sent suggests browsing, downloading, or API calls.

## 🎓 School Deployment Context

In a classroom, this same data would be collected from every student computer, allowing teachers to:

✅ **Monitor Class Engagement**  
- Identify students with low focus levels (like your current 0.11)
- Spot students who are idle or distracted

✅ **Track Productivity Patterns**  
- See which applications students are using
- Measure time spent on productive vs non-productive apps

✅ **Detect Technical Issues**  
- High CPU/memory could indicate struggling machines
- System metrics help IT departments

✅ **Provide Data-Driven Support**  
- Intervene when students show signs of struggle
- Recognize patterns that need attention
