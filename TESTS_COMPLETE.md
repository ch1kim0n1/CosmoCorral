## What Was Tested

### 1. Pattern Detector (4 tests) âœ…
- Builds rolling 5-minute history of activities
- Detects 0 patterns in normal student behavior
- Detects 2+ patterns when keystroke/focus suddenly changes
- Classifies severity correctly (low/medium/high)

### 2. ML Classifier (2 tests) âœ…
- Normal package: 9.65% suspicious score â†’ "none" risk
- Suspicious package: 65.66% suspicious score â†’ "high" risk
- Extracts all 8 features correctly
- Applies weights properly (keystroke 25%, network 25%, etc.)

### 3. Flag Data Generator (1 test) âœ…
- Creates unique flag IDs (UUIDs)
- Generates valid JSON flag files
- Saves to disk correctly
- Includes all required metadata

### 4. Orchestrator (2 tests) âœ…
- Routes packages through complete pipeline
- Returns correct flags/no-flag decisions
- Creates flag files for suspicious packages
- Tracks sessions and provides summaries

### 5. Integration & Performance (2 tests) âœ…
- End-to-end workflow: 9 packages processed, 1 flagged
- Performance: **0.33ms per package** (target: <5ms) â†’ **15x faster!**
- Handles 100-package load without errors
- All components properly glued together

## Key Findings

### âœ… Performance
```
Component Timing:
  Pattern Detection:    ~0.1ms
  ML Classification:    ~0.15ms
  Flag Generation:      ~0.08ms
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  TOTAL:                ~0.33ms per package

Throughput:
  Theoretical: ~3,000 packages/second
  Required:    100 packages/second
  Status:      âœ… 30x ABOVE requirements
```
