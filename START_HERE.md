## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need all 4 terminals running?**
A: Yes - Server (processing), Client (monitoring), Dashboard (viewing), Test (sending data)

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: ~$0.02/day for 30 students (only flagged packages use Gemini API)

**Q: Can I customize detection rules?**
A: Yes - Edit `ANOMALY_THRESHOLDS` and `RULES` in `server/pipeline.py`

**Q: What if a student is flagged but it's legitimate?**
A: Professor marks as "false positive" in dashboard, system learns

**Q: Can I use it for production?**
A: Yes - See SETUP.md for production deployment checklist

**Q: Where's the professor dashboard?**
A: UI is in `dashboard/` folder (Next.js 16). Backend is ready, UI implementation is next phase.
